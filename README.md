# AFANet

  Implementation of Paperï¼šDeep Adaptive Feature Aggregation in Multi-task Convolutional Neural Networks   
  
## Introduction
  ![image](https://github.com/IJCAI2020-MTL/AFANet/raw/master/Architecture.png)   
  The Adaptive Feature Aggregation (AFA) layer for multi-task CNNs, in which a dynamic aggregation mechanism is designed to allow each task adaptively determines the degree to which the feature aggregation of different tasks is needed. We introduce two types of aggregation modules to the AFA layer, which realize the adaptive feature aggregation by capturing the feature dependencies along the channel and spatial axes, respectively.   
  
## Models
  * `/models/pixel_single.py & image_single.py`: single task baseline;   
  * `/models/pixel_hard.py & image_hard.py`: parameters hard sharing baseline;   
  * `/models/pixel_cross.py & image_cross.py`: cross stitch baseline;   
  * `/models/pixel_nddr.py & image_nddr.py`: nddr-cnn baseline;   
  * `/models/pixel_AFA.py & image_AFA.py`: implementation of afa layer;   
  
## Requirements  

  Python >= 3.6  
  numpy  
  PyTorch >= 1.0  
  torchvision >= 0.2   
  tensorboardX  
  
## Installation
  1. Clone the repo:   
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ACMMM2020-MTL/AFANet.git   
    ```   
    ```
    cd AFANet
    ```
  2. For custom dependencies:   
    ```
    pip install matplotlib tensorboardX   
    ```

## For Training   
  1. Download the dataset([NYUv2](https://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html), [Adience benckmark](https://talhassner.github.io/home/projects/Adience/Adience-data.html#frontalized)) and configure the data path.   
  2. Train the single-task and save the pretrained single-task model in `/weights`:   
    ```
    python train_single_*.py
    ```
  3. For pixel tasks, using Deeplabv3+ network with ResNet backbone to conduct semantic segmentation and depth prediction. For image tasks, using ResNet network to conduct age prediction and gender classification (load pretrained model in `/weights`):   
    ```
    python train_afa_*.py
    ```
