# AFANet

  Implementation of Paperï¼šDeep Adaptive Feature Aggregation in Multi-task Convolutional Neural Networks   
  
## Introduction
  The Adaptive Feature Aggregation (AFA) layer for multi-task CNNs, in which a dynamic aggregation mechanism is designed to allow each task adaptively determines the degree to which the feature aggregation of different tasks is needed. We introduce two types of aggregation modules to the AFA layer, which realize the adaptive feature aggregation by capturing the feature dependencies along the channel and spatial axes, respectively.   
  
## Models
  * `/models/pixel_single.py & image_single.py`: single task baseline;   
  * `/models/pixel_hard.py & image_hard.py`: parameters hard sharing baseline;   
  * `/models/pixel_cross.py & image_cross.py`: cross stitch baseline;   
  * `/models/pixel_nddr.py & image_nddr.py`: nddr-cnn baseline;   
  * `/models/pixel_AFA.py & image_AFA.py`: implementation of afa layer;
